# ProMan

## About the app
ProMan is a single page application where users can create and manage task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them. All changes on the website are happening in real time thanks to the use of websockets. Users can create new public or private boards, add new collumns and finally add new tasks to the collumns. Usersc can freely move tasks between different collumns by dragging them around.
